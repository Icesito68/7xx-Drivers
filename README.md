# Windows Driver pack for 7xx snapdragon platform

These drivers have some features in beta for Redmi Note 9S.

These drivers still do not contain anything useful for the Poco X3 Nfc or Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5g NE, many changes are still needed.

This repository contains driver binary files for 7xx snapdragon platform.
All driver binary files form a board support package to be used on 7xx snapdragon platform devices to provide hardware support for the Windows operating system.

These driver files are not perfect, typos may exist, feel free to file an issue on GitHub in case you found any.
